Currently, I'm a post-doctoral fellow in the Dept. ECE, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), working with Prof. [Khaled B. Letaief](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=khaled-ben-letaief-eekhaled).

Prior to this, I have received the Ph.D. degree from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (ShanghaiTech University), Shanghai, China, in 2024, supervised by Prof. [Yong Zhou](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/zhouyong/index.html), and the B.Sc. degree from Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2018.
During Nov. 2022 to Oct. 2023, I was a visiting doctoral researcher in CWC, Oulu university, supervised by Prof. [Mehdi Bennis](https://sites.google.com/view/dr-mehdi-bennis/home).

My research areas include **edge AI, radio resource management, and distributed AI in B5G/6G**.

## Highlighted Ongoing Work

- **Edge LAM**
  - Our first work in edge LAM, ["**Federated Fine-Tuning for Pre-Trained Foundation Models Over Wireless Networks**"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02924), has been submitted to *IEEE Trans. Wireless Commun.*. 
  - By digging deep into the communication and computational logic of LoRA, our work ["**Federated Low-Rank Adaptation with Differential Privacy over Wireless Networks**"](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07806v2), has been submitted to *ICC 2024*. This paper further explore the FedFT framework in conjunction with differential privacy and propose a FedFT with DP framework, which investigates the impact of noise on FedFT with LoRA. The simulation results demonstrate the superiority compared with the [ICLR2024 paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=NLPzL6HWNl). 
  - Our blue picture in edge LAM, "**Edge Large AI Models: Revolutionizing 6G Networks**", has been submitted to *IEEE Commun. Mag.*.
