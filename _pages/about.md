Currently, I'm a post-doctoral fellow in the Dept. ECE, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), working with Prof. [Khaled B. Letaief](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=khaled-ben-letaief-eekhaled).

Prior to this, I have received the Ph.D. degree from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (ShanghaiTech University), Shanghai, China, in 2024, co-supervised by Prof. [Yong Zhou](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/zhouyong/index.html) and Prof. [Yuanming Shi](https://shiyuanming.github.io/), and the B.Sc. degree from Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2018.
During Nov. 2022 to Oct. 2023, I was a visiting doctoral researcher in CWC, Oulu University, supervised by Prof. [Mehdi Bennis](https://sites.google.com/view/dr-mehdi-bennis/home).

My research areas include `edge intelligence`, `edge large AI model`, `federated learning`, and `network optimization`.

## Highlighted Ongoing Work

- **Edge LAM**
  - Our extended research on Edge LAM within the framework of IoT systems, titled ["**Edge Large AI Models: Collaborative Deployment and IoT Applications**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03139)," accepted for publication in *IEEE IoT. Mag.*..
  - Our blue picture in Edge LAM, ["**Edge Large AI Models: Revolutionizing 6G Networks**,"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00321) accepted for publication in *IEEE Commun. Mag.*.
  - Our first work in edge LAM, ["**Federated Fine-Tuning for Pre-Trained Foundation Models Over Wireless Networks**"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10855336), accepted for publication in *IEEE Trans. Wireless Commun.*.
  - By digging deep into the communication and computational logic of LoRA, our work ["**Federated Low-Rank Adaptation with Differential Privacy over Wireless Networks**"](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07806v2) accepted for publication in *MEDITCOM  2025*. This paper further explores the FedFT framework in conjunction with differential privacy and proposes a FedFT with DP framework, which investigates the impact of noise on FedFT with LoRA. The simulation results are superior to the [ICLR2024 paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=NLPzL6HWNl).
